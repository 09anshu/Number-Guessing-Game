# Number Guessing Game - Java GUI

## Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a fun Java-based application with a graphical interface, developed using Swing. The game challenges players to guess a randomly chosen number within a specified range. Players select their preferred difficulty level, and the game provides feedback on their guesses, the number of attempts made, and the time taken. Additionally, users can leave feedback, receive hints, and view performance analysis.

## Features
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy (1-10), Medium (1-50), and Hard (1-100) difficulty settings.
- **Game Timer**: Tracks and displays the time taken to guess the correct number.
- **Attempts Counter**: Keeps count of the number of attempts made.
- **Hint Option**: Offers hints to assist in guessing the correct number.
- **High Score Tracker**: Tracks and displays the lowest number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
- **Performance Analysis**: Provides feedback on performance based on difficulty and average attempts across games.
- **Feedback System**: Accepts user feedback and responds accordingly with helpful suggestions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple, colorful GUI with intuitive controls.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Click "Start Game" and select a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
2. **Make Guesses**: Enter your guesses in the input field and click "Guess." Feedback will indicate if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
3. **View Hints**: Click "Get Hint" if you need assistance with your guess.
4. **Game Feedback**: Once you guess correctly, the game stops and displays your performance statistics. High scores and feedback will be displayed as well.
5. **Provide Feedback**: You can submit feedback on the game by entering it in the feedback text box.

## Installation and Running
1. **Requirements**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
2. **Compile and Run**:
   ```bash
   javac GuessingGameGUI.java
   java GuessingGameGUI
   ```

## Code Structure
- **GuessingGameGUI.java**: The main game logic, including GUI components and event handling.
- **Methods**:
  - `startGame()`: Initializes game variables based on difficulty.
  - `makeGuess()`: Checks the user's guess and provides feedback.
  - `provideHint()`: Offers hints based on the chosen number.
  - `analyzeGame()`: Analyzes game performance and provides insights.
  - `submitFeedback()`: Accepts and responds to user feedback.

## Future Improvements
- **Customizable Themes**: Allow users to select different color schemes.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Enable players to compete against each other for the best score.
- **Leaderboard**: Track and display high scores globally.
